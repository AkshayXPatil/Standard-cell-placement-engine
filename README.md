# Standard-cell-placement-engine
Simulated Annealing based fixed-die standard cell placement engine for IBM benchmark netlists
- I did this project along with Akash Tadmare as a part of Design Automation of VLSI systems course.
- In this project, we have developed a standard cell placement engine based on simmulated annealing process.
- The report file briefly explains the complete simmulated annealing process and discusses about, how this process is used for the purpose of standard cell placement. The report ends with discussion of results and final conclusion.
- simanneal.cpp is the C++ implementation of the simmulated annealing process.
- This code is tested on IBM benchmark circuits given in Benchmark circuits.zip file.
- Readme.txt file explains the step by step procedure to execute the code.
