# Standard-cell-placement-engine
Simulated Annealing based fixed-die standard cell placement engine for IBM benchmark netlists
- I did this project along with [Akash Tadmare](https://github.com/akash10295) as a part of Design Automation of VLSI systems course.
- In this project, we have developed a standard cell placement engine based on simmulated annealing process.
- The [report](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/Standard-cell-placement-engine/blob/master/report.pdf) file briefly explains the complete simmulated annealing process and discusses about, how this process is used for the purpose of standard cell placement. The report ends with discussion of results and final conclusion.
- [simanneal.cpp](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/Standard-cell-placement-engine/blob/master/simanneal.cpp) is the C++ implementation of the simmulated annealing process.
- This code is tested on IBM benchmark circuits given in [Benchmark circuits.zip](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/Standard-cell-placement-engine/blob/master/Benchmark%20circuits.rar) file.
- [Readme.txt](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/Standard-cell-placement-engine/blob/master/readme.txt) file explains the step by step procedure to execute the code.
